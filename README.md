**Project Title:** Network Packet Sniffer Tool

**Description:**

The Network Packet Sniffer Tool is a Python script designed to capture and analyze network packets in real-time. It utilizes the Scapy library to intercept packets traversing the network interface and extract valuable information such as source and destination IP addresses, MAC addresses, and protocols.

**Key Features:**

1. **Packet Capture:** The tool captures network packets as they travel through the specified network interface.

2. **Packet Analysis:** It analyzes each captured packet to extract relevant information, including source and destination IP addresses, MAC addresses, and protocols.

3. **Real-time Monitoring:** The tool provides real-time monitoring of network traffic, allowing users to observe packet activity as it occurs.

4. **Flexible Configuration:** Users can specify the network interface to monitor and customize packet filtering criteria based on their requirements.

5. **Educational Use:** The tool is intended for educational purposes to help users learn about network protocols, packet structures, and network security concepts.

**Target Audience:**

- Students and educators studying networking, cybersecurity, and computer science.
- Network administrators and security professionals interested in network monitoring and analysis.

**Usage Guidelines:**

- Ensure ethical use of the tool by obtaining appropriate permissions before monitoring network traffic.
- Use the tool for educational purposes to deepen understanding of network protocols and security principles.
- Respect privacy and legal considerations when capturing and analyzing network packets.

**Future Enhancements:**

- Support for additional packet analysis features, such as payload inspection and protocol-specific parsing.
- Integration with visualization tools to display network traffic patterns graphically.
- Enhanced error handling and logging for better troubleshooting and debugging.

**Conclusion:**

The Network Packet Sniffer Tool provides a valuable resource for studying network traffic and understanding the intricacies of network communication. With its intuitive interface and powerful features, it serves as an educational tool for exploring the world of networking and cybersecurity.
